# Interrogatives as relativization markers in Indo-European


This study uses definitions tailored to the question at hand, to the specific characteristics of Indo-
European languages, and with the available material in mind. The goal of this study is to better
understand the distribution of IRCs in space and time. Even though Indo-European languages dis-
play a range of constructions and markers when it comes to relativization, only a subset of those
will be considered here. For example, in some languages there are unmarked relative clauses, but
since interrogative pronouns are never zero, these cases are excluded. Furthermore, while this
is not true cross-linguistically, most IE languages have a finite construction for expressing rela-
tivization which facilitates comparison. As mentioned above, the data is collected primarily from
grammars and grammar sketches and thus necessarily limited to the descriptions and examples
provided there. Focusing on a subset of RC constructions allows for a broader sample.
